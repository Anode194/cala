//! ### Note
//! Cala is a complete redesign of previous library [ADI]("https://crates.io/crates/adi").  It is still in it's early stages.
//!
//! # About
//! Easily create cross-platform applications.  Some common tasks are not easily portable across different platforms, and this crate hopes to fix that.  That way you don't have to worry about how to port your GUI, audio, or bluetooth interface, etc. and can get straight to building your application's content!
//!
//! Cala is a platform-agnostic system interface for hardware IO.  This means that eventually, Cala should support all of the different hardware that's connected to your computer.  Cala is designed so that it talks to the operating system to interface with the hardware, so no special permissions are needed for your application.  Here's a list of all of the targeted platforms (**bold** means a port has been made, *italic* means the feature doesn't work on the platform):
//!
//! - **Linux**
//! - **MacOS** - missing [*audio*](https://github.com/libcala/cala/issues/5), [*controller*](https://github.com/libcala/cala/issues/7), [*graphics*](https://github.com/libcala/cala/issues/9)
//! - **Windows** - missing [*audio*](https://github.com/libcala/cala/issues/4), [*controller*](https://github.com/libcala/cala/issues/6), [*graphics*](https://github.com/libcala/cala/issues/8)
//! - **Web (WASM)** - missing audio, controller, graphics, files
//! - Redox
//! - Android
//! - iOS
//! - Nintendo Switch
//! - XBox
//! - PlayStation
//! - FreeBSD
//! - Maybe FreeDOS for fun üòâÔ∏è
//! - Others not on this list that you will make a pull request for adding them
//!
//! # Motivation & Naming
//! The aim is to create a newer, better GTK + SDL in Rust!  Why GTK + SDL?  Because a lot of programs need to depend on both anyway (like [totem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Totem_Video_Player)), and they do a lot of the same things; Usually one library does each specific task better than the other.  The goal of this library is to provide the common ground for video games and general GUI applications together.  The name cala is derived from the fungus known as calafate rust.
//!
//! # Getting Started
//! Each hardware interface can be enabled with a feature.  For example, If you
//! want to depend on the `audio` feature and the `clock`
//! feature, you might put this in your `Cargo.toml`:
//!
//! <!--
//! ```toml
//! [dependencies.cala]
//! version = "0.8"
//! features = ["audio", "clock"]
//! ```
//! -->
//!
//! <p style="width:100%"><pre lang="toml"><code><span style="color:#FFF;font-weight:bold;">[dependencies.cala]</span>
//! <span style="color:#0F0;font-weight:bold;">version</span> = <span style="color:#0F0">"0.8"</span>
//! <span style="color:#0F0;font-weight:bold;">features</span> = [<span style="color:#0F0">"audio"</span>, <span style="color:#0F0">"clock"</span>]</code></pre></p>
//!
//! There is a module for each feature (feature and module names match).  Module documentation may include simple tutorials.  More in depth tutorials may be
//! found [here](https://libcala.github.io/tutorials).

    //!             cala::AudioSample::stereo(lsample, rsample)
    //!         } else {
    //!             // Play silence if not enough has been recorded yet.
    //!             cala::AudioSample::stereo(0, 0)

#[cfg(feature = "files")]

#[cfg(feature = "graphics")]
mod icons;

#[cfg(feature = "graphics")]
#[macro_use]
pub mod graphics {
    //! API for rendering graphics.  Enable with the `graphics` feature.
    //!
    //! # Getting Started
    //! This API is designed to be high-level without sacrificing optimization.
    //! Graphics are complicated though, so before you start, a few things need
    //! to be defined.
    //!
    //! ## Shader
    //! A Shader is a program that runs on the GPU for the purpose of drawing
    //! Shapes.  When you make your program, start by creating a shader.
    //! Shaders are built at compile time, so you'll need to make a build.rs and
    //! depend on the [`res`](https://crates.io/crates/res) crate.  Calling
    //! `generate()` in your build.rs will generate your shaders.
    //!
    //! ## Shape
    //! A shape is a collection of vertices that when connected make a 2D or 3D
    //! shape.  Shapes can only be used with one Shader because they may have
    //! shader-specific additional information attached to them like color or
    //! graphic coordinates.
    //!
    //! ## Instance
    //! Shapes themselves can't be drawn, first you must make an Instance of the
    //! Shape.  Instances can have position attached to them, and/or rotation
    //! and size.
    //!
    //! # Example
    //! ```rust
    //! // TODO
    //! ```
